# 14 Model-View-Controller (MVC): Tech Blog

## Description

Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies.

This CMS-style blog site is similar to a Wordpress site. Developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
